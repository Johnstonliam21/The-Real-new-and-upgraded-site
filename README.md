 <p> The 14-3-2 Montreal Canadiens had another slip but its not like they were gonna win every game. First came Florida which was a long and hard fought battle to the end where Florida 
 snuck in a lucky one in overtime. The habs first loss with Price in the net. In overtime sticks were breaking all over the place. Montreal player skating to his bench too get a new 
 stick when a slapshot came from the point by Aaron Ekblad, snapping his stick and the puck going in the other direction just sneeking by Price. Another game dominated by Montreal but
 not scoring enough. Finally came the rivaled Toronto Maple Leafs, this time getting out shot by Toronto winning the game. The Habs are going to have score more goals playing
 against a team like the Rangers who have 16 more goals for than the habs and only 3 more goals against. Now lets talk about specific players like PAUL BYRON with a whopping
 7 goals tied for the most with Galchenyuk and Shea Weber. This guy doesnt even have powerplay time and he is tied for most goals. He is surprising everyone with how good he is 
 playing. Another player is Torey Mitchell playing on the 4th line and has 5 goals. This is why the habs are doing so well with their depth. Once again I have to talk about Al 
 Montoya, this guy is just not cutting it. We need a back up that we can rely on to get some wins when Price is not in between the pipes. Price has still not lost a game in regulation 
 which shows how good this team actually is when comfortable with an above average goalie in the net. Do you think we should get rid of Al Montoya and if so who should we trade and for whom? <pre> November 21, 2016 </pre> </p>

 <p> The Canadiens coming off another L to the hands of Al Montoya. This one was not neccesarly Montoya's fault but if the habs wanna go for the cup this year
 are they going to have to invest in a better back up goalie. The habs have no troubles with Carey in the net (still undefeated). They are having a great season so far being
13-2-1 but can they be doing better. Montoya would have great stats for a back up if that 10-0 game didn't happen but it doesn't seem that the rest of the team performs
as well when Montoya is in between the pipes. If the habs wanna win, its going to have to be soon. Salary issues will come into play with so many great players on this team.
Do you think the habs need a better back up or is Montoya doing his job?  <pre> November 15, 2016 </pre> </p>

 <p> The Canadians playing against the Los Angelas Kings yesterday continuing the great run. Even while getting out shot 24 to 23 the habs prevailed.
Capitalizing on their chances and Carey playing his game. Galchenyuk continuing to be the top goal scorer on the habs gets another one while Radulov continuing
his assist spree. But we can not concentrate on two or three players for this team. This whole team is holding their weight. Even the fouth line, the fouth
line is doing their job and more but more specifically Torey Mitchell playing with 4th line ice time and getting 5 goals already. But their is players that catch my
attention. Specifically Shea Weber, Gally, Radulov and Carey Price. These four players are leading this team to their wins. Shea Weber with an incredible 16+ on ice,
 Radulov having 12 points in 14 games while 9 of them being assists, Gally rocking that point a game average and Price with a .953 save percentage and a 1.56 goals against
  average. Price has still not lost a game this season (knock on wood), being 9-0. </p>

<p> The Canadians are starting off the year with style. Getting off to a great start the habs are 11-1-1. Doing so well, why is that? Probably because Price is back from injury
or is it something else. Is Price really the whole Canadian team or have the pickups of Alexander Radulov and Shea Weber shaped up this team. With only thirteen games
played, Weber has already showed off his skills scoring 5 goals and having 6 assists while Radulov also showing why he was worth picking up scoring 3 goals and having 8 assists.
But the question was, is Price the whole team; and even with the impressive stats of our players, I am here to say YES. We saw what happens without Price when we played against Columbus. That
might have been the bigest blowout in NHL history. But have the canadians just come to a good start like we have all seen before or are they a team to watch out for this time. They have about 40 goals for 
and were leading the league in goals against before the Columbus game. <pre> November 9, 2016 </pre> </p>
